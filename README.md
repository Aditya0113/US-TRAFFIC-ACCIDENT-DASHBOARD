# US-TRAFFIC-ACCIDENT-DASHBOARD

Dataset Used: US Traffic Accident Data (2016â€“2023)

Tool Used: Power BI

ðŸ”§ Project Features Implemented:

    âœ… Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze US traffic accident data.

    âœ… Performed data cleaning and transformation to prepare accident data for visualization.

    âœ… Created KPIs and advanced visuals to track accident trends, severity, and contributing factors.

    âœ… Enabled geospatial analysis using maps to identify accident-prone regions.

ðŸ“Š Visuals Created:

âœ… KPI Cards:

    Total No. of Accidents: Displays the total recorded accidents (24.78K).

    Average Severity Score: Indicates the overall severity of accidents (2.41).

    Average Temperature (Â°F): Shows the average temperature during accidents (44.85Â°F).

âœ… Line Chart â€“ Total No. of Accidents by Year:

    Illustrates the trend of accidents from 2016 to 2023, showing peaks and declines.

âœ… Donut/Pie Charts:

    Day vs Night (Sunrise/Sunset): Distribution of accidents based on time of day.

    Day vs Night (Traffic Signal): Breakdown of accidents at traffic signals during day/night.

âœ… Donut Chart â€“ Junction Impact:

    Highlights accidents occurring with vs without junction impact.

âœ… Bar Chart â€“ Top 5 Accident Locations:

    Displays states with the highest accident counts (CA, FL, TX, SC, NY).

âœ… Map Visual â€“ US Accident Distribution:

    A geospatial visualization of accidents across the United States.

âœ… Month-wise Filters:

    Allows filtering of accident data by months (Janâ€“Dec) for seasonal analysis.

ðŸ§  Analytics & Insights:

    Accident frequency has shown significant year-to-year variation, peaking around 2021.

    California, Florida, and Texas are the top states with the highest accident counts.

    Night-time accidents are notably higher compared to daytime.

    Traffic signals and junctions play a significant role in accident occurrences.

    Weather factor insight: Accidents occur on average around 44.85Â°F, showing potential weather influence.
